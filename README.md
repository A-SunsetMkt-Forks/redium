Automatically unblock articles through proxies like [12ft](https://12ft.io), [LibMedium](https://libmedium.batsense.net), and [Scribe](https://scribe.rip).

However, it **wonâ€™t** auto redirect if you are on medium.com webpage so that free articles can be read as usual.

But if you open the article in a new tab, or manually click the extension icon, it'll redirect that webpage to the selected proxy. You can also assign a [keyboard shortcut](chrome://extensions/shortcuts) to trigger redirection.

> ðŸ”¥ 12ft supports bypassing articles on other websites apart from medium.com.
