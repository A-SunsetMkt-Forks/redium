Automatically unblock medium articles through proxies like [Scribe](https://scribe.rip), [LibMedium](https://libmedium.batsense.net), and [12ft](https://12ft.io).

However, it **wonâ€™t** auto redirect if you are on medium.com webpage so that free articles can be read as usual.

But if you open the article in a new tab, or manually click the extension icon, it'll redirect that webpage to the selected proxy. You can also assign a keyboard shortcut for it from chrome://extensions/shortcuts.

> ðŸ”¥ 12ft supports many websites other than medium.com but it's kinda hit-or-miss on medium itself. However it provides the best viewing experience when it works.
